This is my portfolio, where you can find little summery of my developer road. Also there are some of
projects that i am using quite often

## Build with

- [Vue.js](https://v3.vuejs.org/) - 3 version, this is like a core of the website, also i am planning to transfer portfolio to [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/)

- [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) - for smoooooth transitions

- [Metaballs.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/metaballs-js) - landing background. P.S. initially was using [particles.js](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/)

- [Butter.js](https://github.com/BCJdevelopment/butter.js) - this makes the page scroll really smoothly on PC

- [Hummer.js](https://hammerjs.github.io/) - this was used for little notification when the form is submitted

- [Tippy.js](https://atomiks.github.io/tippyjs/) - small tooltips for tech i am using
