Hi! I'm **Bogdan Kostyuk** - Ukrainian based Front End developer, passionate about UI effects, animations and code. I love creating things that live on internet. Mostly in use are Nuxt.js and Next.js, Scss for styling and Gsap for smooooth animations, also recently got my hands on three.js. In general, I am problem solver, curios person, fan of F1 and tech.
